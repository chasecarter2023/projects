How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

There are many things that are necessary to make sure that the software is functional and secure. Having a structured 
methodology in place during the planning phase is important to establish before any project is begun. Using a specific 
framework will aid in the development by having guidelines in place to follow. This is to make sure that the requirements 
of the company and the needs of the users are met. Once the development has begun, testing is important to ensure quality 
and function of any program. Testing also allows the developer to see potential threats and vulnerabilities that the 
software is susceptible to. Once the tests have been done adjust the code to make sure that its functionality and security 
are required.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The purpose of the software is for the user. The user will show what they need the software to accomplish. Usersâ€™ stories, 
and the product owner backlog, are two ways that the developer knows what the objective of the project is. Once the developer
knows what the needs of the user are, and what the company requirements are. the software can be developed to accomplish this.

How do I approach designing software?

There are several approaches when designing software. All of which accomplish tasks and the requirements of the company. 
Some ways to approach software design are by using flow charts, pseudocode, and UML diagrams. These approaches give some 
guidance to how the programs should flow. They also provide the sequence of how the code should be organized. By using one 
of these approaches the code can be scalable and easily maintainable.
