How do I approach designing software?
-What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I learned how to design a 3D scene. Starting with the user interactions all the way to the textures of the 3D models.

-What design process did you follow for your project work?
I used the template as the guide. Each mod there was an assignment that went along side the project. I used that as a took for the final as well.

-How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I think that the main take away from this class is the problem solving, also using the resources to help with your goal. 

How do I approach developing programs?
-What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
A new stratigy I used is reading code. I found it extremly helpful reading the code of the sample project. This gave me ideas and help when I was writing my code. 

-How did iteration factor into your development?
Very much so. Iteration assisted me with a guideline, from there I was able to find answers and try differnt things. 

-How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Pacing myself was big for me this semester. Giving myself time to understand how to complete a task was the most important thing for me. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Learning from this class will give me the foundational understanding for 3D Scenes.

-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Everything I do on a normal basis is on a screen. From video games to movies, understanding computational graphics gives me a better respect for them.
