What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

There were many assignments involved in this course. There were many problems that I came across when completing the assignments. 
First, the development of the specific tasks that needed to be completed. Second, properly configuring the application inside the 
Visual Studio IDE in order that it was capable of properly running. Finaly fixing the issues that arise through the entire application.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The first problem was solved by applying the principles that were introduced in the ZyBook. Secondly, for me this was trial and error. 
I tried many different configurations until the application seemed to work and I used that as a baseline in my application. Finally, 
to fix the errors in the application I ran the application through the debug. This aided me with understanding why the application was 
not doing what I need it to do. Thus, understanding the problem the fixing it. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I overcame many roadblocks by reaching out to my professor when I was stuck. I also referred to my book many times to see what syntax 
error may be causing the issue. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Being able to cultivate an application from start to finish was fantastic for me. Reading a book about how to do it is one thing. 
But by doing everything myself I was able to understand how to utilize the correct syntax and connect the dots withing the program.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I think that the work on this project helped have a systematic approach with programming that can be applied to any software design.
