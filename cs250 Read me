How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  
The way that users’ needs need to be interpreted and implemented into a program depends on what problem we are attempting to fix.
Understanding the users’ problems can be solved through programming by understanding the user. As developers, we want to meet 
their expectations while following the requirements of the company we are working for/with. Understanding the users’ stories 
is how we can find out what specific problem they are having. We can use the data from the stories to apply them to the 
software that we are developing. 

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  
The development of software should be structured following s specific process. This allows the quality of the software 
to be constantly improved upon. Developers use frameworks that allow guidelines to follow. The Agile process Scrum is a 
framework that develops software by focusing on incrementally developing it. This process is done by breaking the entire 
project into small portions, this is to be divided within a team or for a single developer. Scrum uses sprint planning and 
retrospectives. I plan on incorporating this into the development of my future work by applying scrum methods.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  
There are many ways to be a good team member. Being a good team member must start with great communication. Communication 
can make or break a team’s success. Being able to communicate strengths and weaknesses will help the development process. 
Another important part of being a good team member is technical skills. Being able to contribute to the team by accomplishing
