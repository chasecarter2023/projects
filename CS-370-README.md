Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project I used a reinforcement learning-based agent. It is used to navigate a treasure maze. It uses reinforcement learning and neural networks to solve a problem. The project used a combination of given code by the instructor and self-created code. We were supposed to find the qtrain function. I used the training loop for the exploration, experience replay, and neural network updates. The provided code contained the structure of the maze and some utility functions. I created the logic for training the agent and optimizing its performance.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists are problem solvers who use technologies to make solutions in different areas. Their work uses design algorithms, developing software, and machine learning. This project is a snapshot of the bigger view of the work in computer science. Algorithms, data structures, and AI models are important for making systems that can grow and learn.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

My approach to solving this problem starts by learning about the project. The agent works and learns by logic from its experiences. I broke down the problem into smaller goals to finish the code. Starting with the actions, making reward system, and using the Q-learning algorithm. This is the typical process in computer science, where problems are separated into manageable pieces. This is also helpful when delegating tasks to teams for bigger projects.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities are to the end user and whatever organization I am working for. For project 2 the ethical considerations are to make the game predictable and safe within the environment. I was sure to consider the implications of the technology like privacy concerns, potential biases in decision-making, and the overall impact on society. I am transparent with the code and accountable with the system. This is important to maintaining trust and fairness.
